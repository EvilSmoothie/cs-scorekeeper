Scorekeeper Project


This is the scorekeeper project based on the Colt Steele Web Developer course. 

The aim is to write a web based app that will have three buttons. A button for each player which will add to their score and a reset button. Each time a player 'scores' they will press the respective button and it will count up each time. The app will stop when the inputted score limit is reached and both player buttons will disable until the app is reset.
